# FibiPHI

As numbers in the Fibonnacci sequence grow larger, the nth term of the Fibonacci Sequence, F(n), divided by the n-1 term, grows increasingly close to the glolden ratio. This App demonstrates this. 

Code is about 80% documented with swift markdown syntax, with documentation generated by Jazzy. Complete documentation is a large goal of the project. The beginnings of the  documentation are visible [here](https://rawgit.com/guthrie-kuckes/FibiPHI/master/docs/index.html).
